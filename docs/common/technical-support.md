# Technical support

This guide is split into to sections.

1. Free support
2. Paid support

## ‚Ä¢ Free support

Avo is designed to be a self-serve product with [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.avohq.io) and [demo apps](#demo-apps) as references.

But, even the best of us get stuck at some point and you might need a nudge in the right direction. There are a few places where you can get help.

## 1. These docs

We work hard to ensure these documentation pages express everything Avo can do and keep them up to date.

<div class="pl-6">

### Left Sidebar

From the sidebar you can check out the major sections where we grouped up similar pieces of information.

### Search

We use Algolia DocSearch so you can quickly find what you're looking for.

### Recipes and FAQ page

We compiled a list of helpful [recipes](./../3.0/guides.html) from ourselves and the community and a few [FAQ](./../3.0/faq.html) items for you to check out.

## 2. GitHub Issues / GitHub Discussions

<div class="pl-6">

Avo is LGPL-licensed and available on GitHub. We love to use GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/issues/) and [Discussions](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/discussions) features to offer support.

### I'm in trouble üò±

So, when you run into troubles, please go on the [issues](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/issues?q=) section and search to see if anyone else encountered your issue and found a way to fix it.

Try out different queries as each person expresses themselves differently. Even if you don't find the exact same problem, it might give yout starting point.

### I found a bug üêõ

This is the perfect oportunity to open a [GitHub issue](https://avo.cool/new-issue). GitHub Issues is the perfect feature where one can ask questions, collaborate, reference other issues or PRs, or present screenshots and videos.

It would be great if you could go through all the information that the issue asks of you (versions and others) as it will help us understand the problem better and shorten the back and forth of us asking that same information.

The second great thing about GitHub Issues is that they are searchable and enables self-help for others.

### I have some feedback

The next best way to send us your feedback and ideas si through GitHub Discussions. Think of GitHub Discussions like our forum where folks can share their thoughts.

:::info
We prefer GitHub Issues over any other form of communication.

## 3. Discord chat

Our [Discod Community](https://avo.cool/chat) is fantastic and it's growing everyday. Thank you for being a part of it.

<div class="pl-6">

### I have a quick question

We know that sometimes you just need to ask a quick question and a chat is the best place for that.
From our experience, few quick questions are actually quick. Most of the times the answer is "it depends", and we need more information about the problem.

The Discord server has a few channels marked `#avo-2`, `#avo-3`, `#resources`, and more to try to narrow down the issues. We have a bot that will open up a thread after each question so it's easier to track the conversation.
When we have time we hang around there and answer some of them. We are lucky that other community members have experience and pitch in from time to time.

There are other more responsive private channels for our customers that need more support and are paying for that increased support. If you'd like to know more about that, please fill out [this form](https://forms.reform.app/ahahHs/technical-support-request/tk3fp0).

</div>

## ‚Ä¢ Paid support

Due to the nature of how time-consuming support is, we can't treat each issue the same or allocate the same amount of time.
The policy is that if it's something simple that we can figure on the spot we will happily answer. If it's something we can reproduce really quick, we will do it and answer the inquiry.

But there are times when we can't reproduce it quickly and more information is needed. That's when we'll ask you to provide a reproduction repository where we can troubleshoot the issue on our local machines quickly by (preferably) just running the app and going through a few provided steps.

When none of the above can be run and the case requires pair programming sessions, we can offer those as a separate paid service.

If you'd like to know more about that, see our standard plans [her](https://avohq.io/support) or reach out to us on the [Discord server](https://avo.cool/chat).

## Demo apps

These apps have been made to showcase the technical abilities of Avo. They all come with the source-code

The [main demo app](https://main.avodemo.com/) is a catch-all all that mimics an internal tool. It has multiple examples about Avo's support to all the edge-cases you might encounter.

The [ticketing demo app](https://ticketing.avodemo.com/) is an example of how you could build a ticketing support app for your customers completely in Avo.
It also features websockets integration for live commenting on tickets alongside a custom tool that serves as a "Settings" page.
